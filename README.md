# CARFAX

Rules:

  1- Add javadoc comments whenever you add a method. Describe in sufficient detail the parameters and the return value.
     Comment the inner working of the method step by step. This will make it easier to find bugs in the implementation of the method
  
  2- Do not create everything in a single class. If a class is too bloated, try to seperate it into smaller classes.
     Don't forget to document the newly added class.
  
  3- In case of merge conflicts, contact me to resolve it together. DO NOT RESOLVE THE CONFLICT YOURSELF (unless it is trivial).
  
  4- It would be preferable if you branched off the master branch for adding new features. This will reduce the headache of when encoutering a bug.

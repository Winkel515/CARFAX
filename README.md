# CARFAX

Rules:

  1- Add javadoc comments whenever you add a method. Describe in sufficient detail the parameters and the return value.
  
  2- Do not create everything in a single class. If a class is too bloated, try to seperate it into smaller classes.
     Don't forget to document the newly added class.
  
  3- In case of merge conflicts, contact me to resolve it together. DO NOT RESOLVE THE CONFLICT YOURSELF (unless it is trivial).
  
  4- It would be preferable if you branched off the master branch for adding new features. This will reduce the headache of when encoutering a bug.
